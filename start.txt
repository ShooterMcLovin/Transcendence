Step-by-Step Guide to Develop Your Pong Contest Website

- Step 1: Understand the Detailed Requirements
Review Game Requirements: Ensure you understand the gameplay mechanics required, including live multiplayer functionality, tournaments, matchmaking, and user registration with 
alias names.
Comply with Default Frontend Constraints: Develop the frontend using pure vanilla JavaScript unless overridden by specified modules or the Graphics module.
Ensure Visual Aesthetics: Maintain the essence of the original Pong game (1972) in terms of visual aesthetics while adhering to modern usability standards.

- Step 2: Set Up Development Environment
Choose IDE: Select an IDE suitable for frontend development, ensuring it supports JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
Version Control: Initialize a Git repository for version control to track changes and collaborate effectively.

- Step 3: Design Backend Architecture (If Applicable)
Backend Decision: Determine if a backend is needed. If required, develop it in pure Ruby unless overridden by specified modules.
Database Design: Design a database schema to store user information, game state, tournament data, and matchmaking details.
Security Considerations: Implement password hashing for stored passwords, protect against SQL injections, XSS attacks, and enforce HTTPS connections.

- Step 4: Implement Core Functionality
User Authentication: Develop user authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring secure login and registration with hashed passwords.
Real-time Multiplayer: Implement WebSocket-based real-time multiplayer functionality for live Pong games between two players sharing the same keyboard.
Tournament System: Develop a tournament system where players can register with alias names and participate in organized matches with clear displays of matchups and player order.
Matchmaking: Implement a matchmaking system within the tournament to organize and announce upcoming matches.

- Step 5: Develop User Interface (UI)
Wireframing: Create wireframes or mockups for the UI design, focusing on simplicity and usability for gameplay interactions.
Single-Page Application (SPA): Ensure the website functions as a single-page application to enable smooth navigation and gameplay flow.
Visual Design: Implement visual elements that reflect the original Pong aesthetics or utilize the Graphics module for enhanced visuals while maintaining gameplay integrity.

- Step 6: Testing and Debugging
Unit Testing: Write unit tests to verify the functionality of critical components such as game mechanics, authentication, and tournament systems.
Integration Testing: Test the integration of frontend and backend components to ensure seamless interaction and functionality across different browsers, especially Google Chrome.

- Step 7: Deployment
Containerization with Docker: Containerize your application using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.
Secure Deployment: Ensure all sensitive credentials and environment variables are stored locally in a .env file and excluded from version control.

- Step 8: Monitoring and Optimization
Performance Optimization: Optimize frontend and backend performance for responsiveness and speed, including code minification and caching strategies.
Monitoring: Implement monitoring tools to track application performance and detect any issues post-deployment.

- Step 9: Documentation
Technical Documentation: Document the project comprehensively, including setup instructions, architecture decisions, API documentation (if applicable), and deployment procedures.
Security Documentation: Detail security measures implemented, including password hashing, HTTPS enforcement, and input validation.

- Step 10: Final Checks and Submission
Quality Assurance: Perform final checks to ensure compliance with all project requirements, including security standards and gameplay functionality.
Prepare for Submission: Package the project for submission, ensuring all documentation and source code are organized and ready for evaluation.

- Step 11: Post-Deployment and Maintenance
Feedback Gathering: Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and future feature enhancements.
Ongoing Maintenance: Plan for regular updates and maintenance to address any issues and keep the application secure and up-to-date.
